### Description

>  This REACT app is designed to keep track of employees through a directory. An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

 > As a user
 > I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once
 > so that I have quick access to their information.
