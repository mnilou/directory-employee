### Installation

> After installing REACT, in the command line, run:
   * npm start
   * npm install axios
   * This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
 
### Usage

> An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
